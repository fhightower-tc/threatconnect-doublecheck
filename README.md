# ThreatConnect DoubleCheck

![Pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/fhightower-tc/threatconnect-doublecheck/badges/master/build.svg)

Library for validating the contents and structure of data in ThreatConnect.

## Objectives

The goals of this project are:

- Provide a way to make sure automated collection systems are creating the correct content correctly
- Provide a way for analysts to make sure intelligence they have created is 'complete' as defined by their/their organization's standards

## Design Principles

This package should:

- Be **modular** enough that it can be used in multiple places/interfaces (local scripts, jobs apps, playbook apps, etc)
- Have a **simple, programmatic interface** so it is useful for analysts and programmers to write into other apps/systems
- **Well-tested** (*enough said*)
- Be **focused** on solving one problem very thoroughly and accurately

## Usage

Coming soon...
